# Prospective Community Organizers

If you are reading this, it means that you are interested in starting a Python community.We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get your group launched as quickly and smoothly as possible. If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the Python community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!To help you get started, we’ve created this open source kit for starting your own Python software community in your region.

## Guidelines for Starting Your Community

When you start your own Python Software Community, you’ll be helping to build and grow a local Python community, through meetups, or sharing info through mailing lists, social media, etc.A Python software community is not meant for a one-time event or workshop. There is an expectation for ongoing community activities through your group, at least once or twice a year. Some of our groups are aiming for monthly events.Ideally, the organizers in your group should be anyone who is enthusiastic about bringing people together to learn, share knowledge and contribute to the spreading of the use of the Python programming language. We also suggest at least two co-organizers in your group to help share the workload and prevent burnout from any single organizer.When requesting a chapter, we ask that it be local and city-based. If a community already exists in your city, a second one may be allowed depending on circumstances. Check [Local User Groups Worldwide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups) to find if there is already a group in your area. If there is no Python user group in your area, please check [Starting Your User Group](https://wiki.python.org/moin/StartingYourUsersGroup) to start one.
