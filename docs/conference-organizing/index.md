# Conference Organizing

There are quite a number of Python conferences happening all year around and in many parts of the world. Many of them are taking place yearly or even more frequent:

- [Python Conferences List on the Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonConferences) -- this is the main and most complete list of conferences around the world

Subsets of this list are also available on other sites:

- [pycon.org](https://www.pycon.org/) -- lists a subset of mostly national Python conferences

- [PyData](https://pydata.org/) -- listings of Python conferences specializing in AI & Data Science

Several of these conferences record the talk sessions on video. [pyvideo.org](https://pyvideo.org/) provides an index to a large set of these videos.

If you are organizing a Python conference or thinking of organizing one, please subscribe to the [Python conferences mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/conferences).
