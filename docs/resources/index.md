## PSF Membership

By [becoming a member](https://www.python.org/psf/membership/), you tell us and the world that you are a part of the PSF and support our work, and as one of the classes of voting members, you add your voice to the future direction of the Foundation.

As a community organizer, you can nominate yourself or community members to become Fellows at the PSF. Fellows are members who have been nominated for their extraordinary efforts and impact upon Python, the community, and the broader Python ecosystem. Visit the [PSF's Fellow Membership page](https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/) to nominate a Fellow or learn more about the process.
