# Community and Conference Organizer Kit

The Python Software Community and Conference Organizers Kit is a comprehensive resource developed by members of the Python Software Community to support individuals and groups in organizing Python-related events and fostering local communities. Adapted from materials by PyLadies Global, this kit offers practical guidance for both new and experienced organizers.

**Whatâ€™s Inside the Kit**

The kit is structured to assist organizers at various stages.

## Adopting this Kit

This kit was inspired by PyLadies Global


## Local Context Matters

While reading these documents, keep in mind that the recommendations here are based on what has worked well for organizers in their local communities. Your local culture may have different constraints and preferences, and you are the expert in your area. For example, if these docs suggest WhatsApp and you know folks around you use Telegram instead, trust your knowledge and use Telegram.
